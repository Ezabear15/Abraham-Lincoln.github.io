Abraham Lincoln

Abraham Lincoln was the 16th president of the United States, serving from 1861 to 1865. He is considered one of America's greatest heroes for his role in the Civil War and his efforts to end slavery: 
Emancipation Proclamation
In 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared that all slaves in areas controlled by the Confederacy were free. This document also allowed African American men to serve in the U.S. military for the first time. 
Civil War leadership
Lincoln led the country through the Civil War, a time of great crisis. He appointed Ulysses S. Grant as Lieutenant General in 1864, and celebrated the Union victory at Appomattox Court House in April 1865. 
Reconstruction
Lincoln had a plan for Reconstruction that focused on reuniting the country, not punishing the South. He advocated for pardoning most Southerners and allowing them to regain their property. 
Assassination
Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865, while attending a play in Washington, D.C. Lincoln was the first president to be assassinated in office.
